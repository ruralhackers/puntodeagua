# Code Style Guidelines
- don't have to include jsdoc comments
- do avoid type assertions, only when is absolutely necessary
- Let TypeScript infer return types from function implementations, only explicitly declare return types in interfaces and abstract methods.
- Naming: Follow Domain-Driven Design patterns
- Architecture: Application, Domain, Infrastructure layers
- Packages: Monorepo with workspaces in packages/* /apps/*
- Comments Language: Use always english language for comments

## Commands

- DB client generate: `bun db:generate`
- DB sync: `bun db:push`
- TEST: `TEST_LOGGER=1 bun test <file_path: ex. packages/business/rest-of-the-path>`
