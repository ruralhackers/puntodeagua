- Priority level

### Issue Labels

- `bug` - Something isn't working

- `help wanted` - Extra attention needed
- `question` - Further information requested
- `priority: high/medium/low` - Priority levels

## Pull Request Process

1. **Use the PR template** - Fill out all relevant sections
2. **Link to issues** - Reference related issues using "Closes #123"
3. **Keep PRs focused** - One feature/fix per PR
4. **Write clear descriptions** - Explain what and why
5. **Add tests** - Include tests for new functionality
6. **Update documentation** - Update README, comments, etc.

### PR Review Process

- All PRs require review from maintainers
- Address feedback promptly
- Keep PRs up to date with main branch
- Squash commits before merging (if requested)

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Follow the existing code patterns
- No JSDoc comments required (TypeScript provides type safety)

### Domain-Driven Design

- Respect bounded context boundaries
- Keep domain logic in the domain layer
- Use proper entity and value object patterns
- Follow the existing architecture patterns

### File Organization

- Follow the monorepo structure
- Use the `@pda/package-name` naming convention
- Keep related files together
- Use descriptive file names

### Formatting

We use Biome for code formatting and linting:

```bash
# Format code
bun run format

# Check for issues
bun run check
```

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for business logic
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Test error cases and edge cases
- Aim for good test coverage

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Run tests in watch mode
bun test --watch

# Run tests with coverage
bun test --coverage
```

## Commit Message Guidelines
